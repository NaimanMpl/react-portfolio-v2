            One of the most striking aspects of the game is its visual aesthetics. What makes Minecraft valuable despite being a decade old is that it never ages. It doesnâ€™t become an experience that our imagination embellishes over time but remains, for each player, a piece of our simpler past. This forces respect and has been a constant source of motivation to implement this clone.
